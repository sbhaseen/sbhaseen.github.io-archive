## [Bad passwords and the NIST guidelines](https://github.com/sbhaseen/Python/blob/master/DataCamp_Mini_Projects/DataCamp_Bad_passwords_and_NIST_guidelines.ipynb)

Data: fictional user database  
Methods: Cleaning data, natural language processing  

This project investigates the insights from the NIST publication 800-63B and how the relative effectiveness of passwords vary based on the use of different character combinations.  


## [Exploring 67 years of LEGO](https://github.com/sbhaseen/Python/blob/master/DataCamp_Mini_Projects/DataCamp_Exploring_67_years_LEGO.ipynb)

Data:  Rebrickable LEGO block database  
Methods: Importing data, cleaning data, data manipulation, data visualization

This fun little project explores different trends of LEGO sets across 67 years.  


## [Exploring the Bitcoin cryptocurrency market](https://github.com/sbhaseen/Python/blob/master/DataCamp_Mini_Projects/DataCamp_Exploring_Bitcoin_cryptocurrency_market.ipynb)

Data:  coinmarketcap API  
Methods: Cleaning data, data manipulation

This project explores the impact, market capitalization and volatility of various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin.  


## [Exploring the evolution of Linux](https://github.com/sbhaseen/Python/blob/master/DataCamp_Mini_Projects/DataCamp_Exploring_evolution_of_Linux.ipynb)

Data:  Linus Torvalds GitHub repository   
Methods: Importing & cleaning data, data manipulation & visualization  

This project delves into the evolution of Linux as a collaborative project based on the Git repository commit information.    


## [Mobile Games A/B-testing with Cookie Cats](https://github.com/sbhaseen/Python/blob/master/DataCamp_Mini_Projects/DataCamp_Mobile_Games_Ab-testing.ipynb)

Data:  Cookie Cats user retention data   
Methods: Probability & statistics, data manipulation & visualization  

This project analyzes the impact of changing a feature of a product or service using A/B testing. In this case, the analysis is applied to user retention data from the mobile game Cookie Cats.  


## [A Network analysis of Game of Thrones](https://github.com/sbhaseen/Python/blob/master/DataCamp_Mini_Projects/DataCamp_Network_analysis_Game_of_Thrones.ipynb)

Data:  Cookie Cats user retention data   
Methods: Network analysis, data manipulation & visualization  

This fun little project uses network analysis techniques to determine the relations between various characters in the Game of Thrones universe.  


## [Risk and Returns: The Sharpe Ratio](https://github.com/sbhaseen/Python/blob/master/DataCamp_Mini_Projects/DataCamp_Risk_Returns_Sharpe_Ratio.ipynb)

Data:  S&P 500 benchmarks  
Methods: Applied finance, importing & cleaning data, data manipulation & visualization  

This project explores the Sharpe ratio as a metric to evaluate the risk versus reward for a given stock investment based on returns.  


## [Word frequency in Moby Dick](https://github.com/sbhaseen/Python/blob/master/DataCamp_Mini_Projects/DataCamp_Word_frequency_Moby_Dick.ipynb)

Data:  Project Gutenberg version of Moby Dick  
Methods: Natural language processing, web scraping, importing & cleaning data, data manipulation  

This project uses natural language processing techniques to analyze the word frequency in the novel Moby Dick as an exercise to sort through unstructured data.
