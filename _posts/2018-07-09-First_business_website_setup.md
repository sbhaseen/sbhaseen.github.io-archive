Made my own website for my consulting business.

---

## Summary:

Had to quickly update all my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS to get up and running to modern standards. [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) was a good resource.
The hardest part was making the cloud deployment on AWS CloudFront, as I'd never done that before.
It took a few Google searches and forum reading, but I finally did it.

After successfully deploying the base version, I looked into security. [Mozilla's Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/) was good for this.

Check out the business website [iSquare Logix](https://isquarelogix.com).
