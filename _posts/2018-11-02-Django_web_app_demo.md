Developed and deployed a Django web app.

---

## Highlights:

Being well versed in Python, I decided to give web apps a try. To that end I started learning about Django. I read the [official documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/) and also did a [tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Tutorial_local_library_website) offered by Mozilla Developer Network.
Additionally, this project made me start thinking more about front end design such as UI elements and layouts, as such I started using the Bootstrap framework as it eases a lot of the styling.
To make things a bit easier and not have to worry about configurations, the final deployment was on Heroku. The GitHub repo can be found [here](https://github.com/sbhaseen/django_web_app_demo).

Update: This project was formely hosted on Heroku, but is now archieved for reference code only.
