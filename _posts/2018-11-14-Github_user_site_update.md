An update for my GitHub profile page.

---

## Briefly:

I've learned a lot more about web design since starting my consulting business and figured it was time to refresh my basic looking GitHub personal page.
I used all my acquired knowledge of web development and UI/UX design to make a better looking site than the old one. The original version was just scraped together from various default assets offerent by GitHub and Jekyll. In the process I also learned a little more about Jekyll sites, Ruby and gems.
